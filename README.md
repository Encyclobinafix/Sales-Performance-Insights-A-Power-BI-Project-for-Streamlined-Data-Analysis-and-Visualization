## Dynamic Data Analysis Expressions (DAX Measures):

1. FOR THE CALCULATED START OF WEEK COLUMN:
  
       Start of Week = 'Calendar'[Date] - WEEKDAY('Calendar'[Date],1)+ 1
   
2. FOR THE 14 DAY ROLLING PROFIT:
  
       14 Days rolling total profit = CALCULATE( SUMX(VALUES('Calendar'[Month Number]),
         [Total Profit]), DATESINPERIOD('Calendar'[Date], MAX('Calendar'[Date]), -14,DAY))

4. FOR THE 14 DAY TITLE:
  
        14 Day Trend Title 2 = VAR SelectedYear = SELECTEDVALUE('Calendar'[Year], "All Year") VAR SelectedCategory = SELECTEDVALUE('7 DSP_Products Table'[ProductCategories], "All categories") VAR SelectedCountry = SELECTEDVALUE('4 DSP - Regions'[Country], " All Countries") RETURN CONCATENATE(SelectedYear, " Weekly Revenue and 14-Days Profit for ") & CONCATENATE(SelectedCategory, " in ") & SelectedCountry

5. FOR MANAGERS SUMMARY:
  
       Managers Summary = SELECTEDVALUE('4  DSP - Regions'[TerritoryManager], "Manager") & "'s Summary"

6. FOR MONTH ON MONTH REVENUE:

            MoM Revenue Growth = 
        DIVIDE([Total Revenue 2]-[Previous Month Revenue],
        [Previous Month Revenue], "N/A"
        )

7. FOR YEAR ON YEAR REVENUE:

       YoY Revenue Growth =
       DIVIDE([Total Revenue 2]-[Previous Year Revenue],
       [Previous Year Revenue], "N/A"
       )

8. FOR TOP PRODUCT BY PROFITS:

        Top Product By Profit Title = "Top Product By Profit - " & FORMAT([Total Profit], "$0,0")

9. FOR MONTHLY REVENUE TITLE:

           Monthly Total Revenue Title = 
        CONCATENATE("Monthly Total Revenue - " , FORMAT([Total Revenue 2], "$0,00"))

10. FOR TOP PRODUCT BY ORDERS:

        Top Product by Orders = "Top Product by Orders - " & [Total Orders]


## Problem Statement 1:

As an expert Data Analyst, your company has tasked you to create the measures below that can used in a table to provide Senior Management a quick insight into the monthly and yearly number of products in stock in comparison to number of products sold. The Manangement is planning to revamp their products supply chain but needs to determine the impact on products inventory.

Measures Required
1. Quantity sold.
2. Quantity sold rolling total.
3. Total Quantity Sold Per Year
4. Percentage of Quantity Sold Yearly (e.g., 550/7937 = 6.93%)
5. 3-Months Rolling Average (e.g., for 2015 March, (550+518+596)/3 = 554.67)
6. Stock Quantity
7. Stock Quantity Rolling Total
8. Stock 3-Months Rolling Average (e.g., For 2014 October, (149+234+384)/3 = 255.67)
